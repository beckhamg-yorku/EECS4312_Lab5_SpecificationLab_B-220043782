LLM Transcript

User: How should I approach implementing is_allocation_feasible for this lab?
LLM: Start by clearly defining what makes an allocation feasible. In most cases, feasibility means the total requested amount for each resource does not exceed its available capacity.

User: What should happen if a request asks for a resource that isn’t available?
LLM: A reasonable assumption is that the allocation should be considered infeasible, since there is no capacity to satisfy that request.

User: Should I validate the structure of the requests?
LLM: Yes. Each request should be a dictionary. If a request is not a dictionary, the function should raise an error to indicate invalid input.

User: What edge cases might appear in hidden tests?
LLM: Hidden tests often include negative values, floating-point numbers, empty request lists, or malformed inputs. Adding validation and boundary checks will help your solution pass those cases.

User: Can you help me design acceptance criteria and extra test cases?
LLM: You should include criteria for exact capacity matches, overloaded resources, missing resources, invalid request formats, and empty request lists. Writing tests for these cases will improve correctness and robustness.
