The transcript shows my interaction with the LLM where I used it to clarify the problem requirements, especially around input formats, 
edge cases, and hidden test expectations. It helped me generate stronger acceptance criteria and additional 
test cases to prevent common failures like missing resources or invalid request structures. Overall, 
the interaction improved both my understanding of the task and the reliability of my final implementation.
